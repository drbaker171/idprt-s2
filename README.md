This is Python code to make the IDPRT S2 Series thermal printer slash sticker printer found off Amazon. amazon.com/dp/B0F2SJ2TZ4?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_1
I got this for $8.99. Although, it looks like the price just doubled, so it may go on sale.   They also had a different model that's cheaper. It may work with that. 
I modified the code from This GitHub. https://github.com/thirtythreedown/CTP500PrinterApp
